âˆ™ Funding support provided to Hospice of Waterloo Region, Sexual Assault Support Centre of Waterloo Region, Fashion History Museum of Cambridge
âˆ™ Approximate budget total: 514 million
The planned region of Waterloo budget approved for 2018 is expected to cost households and additional $53. 
This change includes a 2.74% tax increase, down from the 3.08% proposed at the beginning of deliberations. 
Despite the rise, the region accomplished a 0.25% decrease in the levy of taxpayer funds to be dedicated to the ongoing construction of the LRT, in spite of the $50 million increase to the project's overall cost. Organizations who will receive support grants include the Hospice of Waterloo Region ($250,000), the Sexual Assault Support Centre of Waterloo Region ($50,000), and the Fashion History Museum of Cambridge ($50,000). Budgetary considerations concluded with talk of a potential policy review surrounding funding of the region's cultural organizations.
